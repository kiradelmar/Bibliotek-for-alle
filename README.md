## Description

This repository contains data from a national survey about LGBTQIA+ people's attitudes toward and experiences with public libraries in Norway. Three parallel surveys with different target populations (LGBTQIA+ people, cisgender heterosexual people, and librarians) are included in the data. Qualitative responses have been removed from the dataframe in order to ensure respondents' anonymity. If you are a researcher interested in working with qualitative data from this project, please feel free to contact me (kira.delmar@gmail.com).
