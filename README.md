## Description

This repository contains data from a national survey about LGBTQIA+ people's attitudes toward and experiences with public libraries in Norway. Three parallel surveys with different target populations (LGBTQIA+ people, cisgender heterosexual people, and librarians) are included in the data. Qualitative responses have been removed from the dataframe in order to ensure respondents' anonymity. If you are a researcher interested in working with qualitative data from this project, please feel free to contact me (kira.delmar@gmail.com). 

## Getting Started

Full survey data (with qualitative columns removed) is in the tsv files. Jupyter notebooks contain my groupings, plotting functions, and statistical analysis, as well as interactive elements when used together with Voilà. 

Column and group names are in mixed Norwegian and English, because that is how my brain works these days. If you need any help understanding what's going on, please feel free to get in touch. I will be working toward standardizing names in English.
